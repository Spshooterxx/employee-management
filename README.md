# Employee Management System

A simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built with:

- **ASP.NET Core Web API (Backend)**
- **Entity Framework Core + MSSQL Database**
- **Angular (Frontend with Material UI)**

This project demonstrates a full-stack application where the backend provides REST APIs for managing employee data, and the frontend consumes those APIs with a clean UI.
